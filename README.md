# 🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
- Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is one of the most serious illnesses in both India and the rest of the globe. 
- According to estimates, cardiac illnesses account for 28.1% of fatalities.
- More than 17.6 million fatalities, or a large portion of all deaths in 2016, were caused by it in 2016. 
- Therefore, a system that can predict with exact precision and dependability is required for the appropriate and prompt diagnosis as well as the treatment of such diseases. 
- Numerous academics do extensive research utilising a variety of machine learning algorithms to predict heart illness using different datasets that contain numerous factors that lead to heart attacks. 
- Now it is your turn to do a analysis with the given dataset.

- `sex` — Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)  
- `cp` — Chest pain type  
- `trestbps` — Resting blood pressure  
- `chol` — Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)  
- `fbs` — Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)  
- `restecg` — Resting electrocardiographic results  
- `thalach` — Maximum heart rate achieved  
- `exang` — Exercise-induced angina  
- `oldpeak` — ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest  
- `slope`, `ca`, `thal` — Additional ECG and heart-related indicators  
- `target` — 1 indicates presence of heart disease; 0 indicates absence.
